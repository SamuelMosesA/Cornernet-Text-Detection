CMake Warning (dev) at /home/samuel-moses/Software/clion-2020.1.2/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:272 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (torch) does
  not match the name of the calling package (Torch).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /home/samuel-moses/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/share/cmake/Torch/TorchConfig.cmake:130 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
